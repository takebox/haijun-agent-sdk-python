r"""Shared validation for Haijun Code CLI version strings.

update_cli_version.py writes the version into src/haijun_agent_sdk/_cli_version.py
and download_cli.py reads it back out and hands it to an installer, so the rule
lives here once rather than in two copies that could drift apart.

The installer is the authority on what a version may be. install.sh (and
install.ps1) enforce

    ^(stable|latest|[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+(-[^[:space:]]+)?)$

VERSION_PATTERN admits a deliberate *subset* of that: the installer's `-[^\s]+`
suffix would accept quotes, backslashes and semicolons, so the suffix here is
narrowed to the characters real versions use. Never widen it back toward the
installer's -- update_cli_version.py writes this value into a Python string
literal in a real source file.

"latest" and "stable" are the installer's dist-tags, and they are *moving*:
fine for a download, wrong for a pin, since _cli_version.py is the only record
of which build went into the wheels. Hence ``allow_dist_tag``.

VERSION_PATTERN is deliberately unanchored, and matched with fullmatch(): with
"^...$" a swap to match() would silently accept a trailing newline ("1.0.0\n");
unanchored, the same swap accepts an obvious prefix like "1.0.0; id" and fails
loudly in tests.
